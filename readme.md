# Oscar Car Rental App
## _Cars processing_


The APP creates & displays a catalog of cars for renting. In order to upload/create the cars, the app can read JSON & CSV files and saves the different kind of specifications of each car. It is also possible to create & visualize cars via GET/POST requests to the API. The App was created with Vanilla PHP.

## Usage

- To create cars from a CSV or JSON file, POST Request to <host>/<app>/api/v1/upload_file sending a form-data with key => file, value => file to upload.
- To create a single car, POST Request to <host>/<app>/api/v1/create_single sending for example the following format 
__{"License plate":"PJ9273542","Car km":30000,"Location":"RÃ¸nde","Car year":2022,"Number of doors":5,"Number of seats":5,"Inside height":2.5,"Inside length":3,"Inside width":2.3,"Car Brand":"Fiat","Car Model":"Panda","Car Type":"Small car","Fuel Type":"Petrol","Transmission":"Manual" }__
- To read all the cars, make a GET request to <host>/<app>/api/v1/upload_file.

## Tech

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) - Programming language
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - Programming language
- [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) - Tool to check the code's security
